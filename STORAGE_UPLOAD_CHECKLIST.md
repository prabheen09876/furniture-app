# Storage Upload Troubleshooting Checklist

## ✅ Good News: Image Processing is Working!

The logs show that image processing is now working correctly:
- ✅ Blob creation successful (163,649 bytes)
- ✅ Image format detected (image/jpeg)
- ✅ File path generated correctly

## ❌ Issue: Storage Upload Failing

The final step fails with "Network request failed" during Supabase Storage upload.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Steps

### Step 1: Check Storage Setup
**Most likely cause**: Storage bucket and policies not configured

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard** → **SQL Editor**
2. **Run the complete storage setup**:
   ```sql
   -- Copy and paste the entire content of complete_storage_setup.sql
   -- This creates buckets, policies, and tables
   ```
3. **Verify setup** by running `debug_storage_setup.sql`

### Step 2: Check Authentication
**Second most likely cause**: User not properly authenticated

1. **In the app**, make sure you're signed in
2. **Check logs** for authentication messages
3. **Try signing out and back in**

### Step 3: Check Network Connectivity
**Third possibility**: Network or project issues

1. **Check internet connection** on the device
2. **Verify Supabase project is active** (not paused)
3. **Check project URL and keys** in environment variables

### Step 4: Run Diagnostic Script
**For detailed analysis**:

1. **Open React Native Debugger** or device console
2. **Copy and paste** `diagnose_storage_upload.js` content
3. **Run the script** and check the detailed output
4. **Follow the specific guidance** provided by the diagnostic

## 🎯 Expected Diagnostic Results

### If Storage Setup is Missing:
```
❌ Products storage bucket not found
💡 Run complete_storage_setup.sql in Supabase SQL Editor
```

### If Authentication Issue:
```
❌ No active session - user not signed in
💡 Sign in to the app first
```

### If Network Issue:
```
❌ Network connectivity test failed
💡 This indicates a network connectivity problem
```

### If Everything is Correct:
```
✅ User authenticated: user@example.com
✅ Products bucket exists
✅ Upload successful
✅ Storage diagnostic completed successfully!
```

## 🚀 Quick Fix Commands

### 1. Storage Setup (Run in Supabase SQL Editor):
```sql
-- Create storage buckets
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public, file_size_limit, allowed_mime_types)
VALUES ('products', 'products', true, 52428800, ARRAY['image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'image/webp', 'image/gif'])
ON CONFLICT (id) DO UPDATE SET
  public = EXCLUDED.public,
  file_size_limit = EXCLUDED.file_size_limit,
  allowed_mime_types = EXCLUDED.allowed_mime_types;

-- Create storage policies
CREATE POLICY "Public read access for products"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
USING (bucket_id = 'products');

CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can upload products"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'products' AND auth.role() = 'authenticated');
```

### 2. Test Upload (Run in app console):
```javascript
// Quick test
const testBlob = new Blob(['test'], { type: 'text/plain' });
supabase.storage.from('products').upload('test.txt', testBlob)
  .then(result => console.log('Test result:', result))
  .catch(error => console.error('Test error:', error));
```

## 📋 Checklist Summary

- [ ] **Storage buckets created** (run complete_storage_setup.sql)
- [ ] **Storage policies configured** (included in setup script)
- [ ] **User is authenticated** (check sign-in status)
- [ ] **Network connectivity works** (test internet access)
- [ ] **Supabase project is active** (check dashboard)
- [ ] **Environment variables correct** (SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY)

## 🎉 Expected Final Result

After fixing the storage setup, you should see:
```
✅ Blob created successfully
✅ Attempting to upload to path: product-images/...
✅ Upload successful: { path: "product-images/...", id: "..." }
✅ Image uploaded successfully
```

## 💡 Most Common Solutions

1. **90% of cases**: Missing storage bucket → Run `complete_storage_setup.sql`
2. **8% of cases**: Authentication issue → Sign out and back in
3. **2% of cases**: Network/project issue → Check connectivity and project status

Run the diagnostic script to identify which category your issue falls into!
