# Android Image Upload Fix

This document explains the changes made to fix image upload issues on Android APK builds.

## Problem Description

The app was unable to upload images from Android APK built via EAS Expo, while it worked fine on the web platform. This was due to differences in how mobile platforms handle file URIs and blob conversion.

## Solution Overview

The fix implements a multi-tiered approach with fallback mechanisms specifically for mobile platforms:

1. **Primary**: Use `expo-image-manipulator` to process and normalize images
2. **Fallback 1**: Use `expo-file-system` to read images as base64
3. **Fallback 2**: Use direct fetch approach

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Dependencies

Added `expo-image-manipulator` package to handle image processing:

```json
"expo-image-manipulator": "~12.1.2"
```

### 2. Updated Configuration

Added the plugin to `app.json`:

```json
"plugins": [
  "expo-router",
  "expo-font", 
  "expo-web-browser",
  "expo-image-picker",
  "expo-image-manipulator",
  "expo-camera"
]
```

### 3. Code Changes

#### Products Upload (`app/admin/products.tsx`)
- Added `expo-image-manipulator` import
- Implemented robust mobile image processing with multiple fallback approaches
- Added image compression and format normalization (converts to JPEG)
- Improved error handling with specific error messages

#### Banners Upload (`app/admin/banners.tsx`)  
- Same improvements as products upload
- Consistent approach across all image upload features

### 4. Key Improvements

1. **Image Manipulation**: 
   - Automatically resizes large images (max 2048x2048)
   - Compresses images to 80% quality
   - Converts all images to JPEG format for consistency
   - Provides base64 output that works reliably across platforms

2. **Fallback System**:
   - If image manipulator fails, falls back to FileSystem approach
   - If FileSystem fails, tries direct fetch
   - Provides detailed logging for debugging

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Specific error messages for different failure scenarios
   - Better user feedback
   - Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting

## Installation Steps

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

2. **Clean and rebuild**:
   ```bash
   npx expo prebuild --clean
   ```

3. **Build for Android**:
   ```bash
   eas build --platform android
   ```

## Testing

To test the fix:

1. Install the APK on an Android device
2. Navigate to Admin → Products or Admin → Banners
3. Try uploading images from the device gallery
4. Verify that images upload successfully and appear in the UI

## Technical Details

### Image Processing Flow (Mobile)

```
Image Selection
    ↓
expo-image-manipulator
    ├── Success → Convert to Blob → Upload
    ├── Failure → FileSystem.readAsStringAsync
    │   ├── Success → Convert base64 to Blob → Upload
    │   └── Failure → Direct fetch
    │       ├── Success → Upload blob
    │       └── Failure → Show error
```

### Web Platform
Web platform continues to use the original File object approach without changes.

## Troubleshooting

If image uploads still fail:

1. Check the console logs for specific error messages
2. Verify that storage buckets are properly configured in Supabase
3. Ensure proper permissions in `app.json`
4. Test with different image formats and sizes

## Benefits

- ✅ **Universal Compatibility**: Works on both Android APK and web
- ✅ **Optimized Images**: Automatic compression and resizing
- ✅ **Better Performance**: Smaller file sizes due to compression
- ✅ **Reliable Uploads**: Multiple fallback mechanisms
- ✅ **Consistent Format**: All images converted to JPEG
- ✅ **Better Error Handling**: Clear error messages for users

## Version Compatibility

This fix is compatible with:
- Expo SDK 53+
- React Native 0.79+
- Android API level 21+ (Android 5.0+)
- iOS 13+

The changes maintain backward compatibility and don't affect existing functionality.
