# ✅ Easy APK Build - You're Almost There!

## 🎯 **Current Status**
- ✅ You're logged in to EAS as: `prabheen09876`
- ✅ Project is configured correctly
- ✅ Android bundle was successfully exported
- ❌ Local build failed (Java/Android SDK not installed)

## 🚀 **Solution: Use EAS Cloud Build (No Java Required)**

Since you don't have Java/Android SDK installed locally, use Expo's cloud build service:

### **Step 1: Initialize EAS Project**
Run this command in your terminal:
```bash
npx eas-cli init
```

**What will happen:**
- It will ask: "Would you like to create a project for @prabheen09876/furniture-expo-app?"
- Type `y` and press Enter
- This creates the project on Expo's servers

### **Step 2: Build APK**
After initialization, run:
```bash
npx eas-cli build --platform android --profile preview
```

**What will happen:**
- Build starts on Expo's cloud servers
- Takes about 10-15 minutes
- You'll get a download link when complete
- No Java/Android SDK required on your machine!

## 🔄 **Alternative: Use Pre-built Bundle**

I noticed your `expo export` command worked! The Android bundle is ready at:
`dist/_expo/static/js/android/entry-191aa6ee1466eeede34f15f887181f5a.hbc`

You can use this with Expo Go app:

### **Option A: Test with Expo Go**
1. Install "Expo Go" app on your Android device
2. Run: `npx expo start --tunnel`
3. Scan QR code with Expo Go app
4. Test your app directly!

### **Option B: Create Development Build**
```bash
npx eas-cli build --platform android --profile development
```
This creates a development APK that includes Expo Go functionality.

## 📱 **Recommended Next Steps**

**For Production APK (Recommended):**
```bash
# 1. Initialize project
npx eas-cli init

# 2. Build production APK
npx eas-cli build --platform android --profile preview
```

**For Quick Testing:**
```bash
# Start development server
npx expo start --tunnel

# Then use Expo Go app to scan QR code
```

## 🎉 **Why EAS Build is Better**

- ✅ No need to install Java/Android SDK
- ✅ No need to set up ANDROID_HOME
- ✅ Builds happen on powerful cloud servers
- ✅ Automatic signing and optimization
- ✅ Works from any machine
- ✅ Professional build pipeline

## 🔧 **Commands to Run Now**

Copy and paste these commands one by one:

```bash
# Initialize EAS project (answer 'y' when prompted)
npx eas-cli init

# Build APK (wait for completion)
npx eas-cli build --platform android --profile preview
```

The cloud build will handle everything - no Java installation needed!
